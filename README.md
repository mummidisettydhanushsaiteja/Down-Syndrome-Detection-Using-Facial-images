# 🧬 Down Syndrome Detection Using Facial Images

This project aims to detect Down syndrome in children using facial images with deep learning and transfer learning techniques.

Project Overview  
Down syndrome is a genetic disorder caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21. Early detection can help in better treatment and support. This system analyzes facial images and predicts whether a person has Down syndrome or not.

Features  
- Facial image-based classification system  
- Transfer learning using pretrained CNN models like VGG16 and MobileNet  
- Backend developed using Python  
- Web-based interface using Flask, HTML, and CSS  
- Machine learning models stored in .joblib format  

Technologies Used  
- Python  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- Scikit-learn  
- OpenCV  
- Flask  
- HTML, CSS  
- Jupyter Notebook

Dataset  
The dataset is not uploaded due to large file size. Public research datasets can be used for training.

Results  
The model extracts facial features using deep learning and classifies Down syndrome with good accuracy. Performance can be improved using larger datasets and advanced CNN models.

Future Enhancements  
- Improve accuracy using deep CNN architectures  
- Mobile application integration  
- Cloud deployment on AWS, Azure, or GCP  
- Real-time face detection using webcam  
- Integration with hospital systems
