# Down Syndrome Detection Using Facial Images

This project focuses on detecting Down syndrome in children using facial images with the help of deep learning and transfer learning techniques.

## 📌 Project Overview
Down syndrome is a genetic disorder caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21. Early detection can help in providing better medical care and support. This project analyzes facial images and classifies whether the person has Down syndrome or not using machine learning and deep learning models.

## 🚀 Features
- Facial image-based classification system  
- Transfer learning using pretrained CNN models (VGG16, MobileNet)  
- Backend developed using Python  
- Web-based interface using Flask, HTML, and CSS  
- Machine learning models stored in `.joblib` format  

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- Python  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- Scikit-learn  
- OpenCV  
- Flask  
- HTML, CSS  
- Jupyter Notebook

```

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset is not uploaded to GitHub due to large file size.
Public facial image datasets and research datasets can be used for training.

## 📈 Results

The model uses transfer learning to extract facial features and classify Down syndrome with good accuracy. Further improvements can be made by increasing dataset size and using advanced models.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

* Improve accuracy using deep CNN architectures
* Mobile application integration
* Cloud deployment (AWS / Azure / GCP)
* Real-time face detection using webcam
* Integration with hospital systems
