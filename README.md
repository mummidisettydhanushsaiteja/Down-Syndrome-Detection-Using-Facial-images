📊 Dataset  
Dataset is not uploaded due to large file size. Public research datasets can be used for training.

📈 Results  
The model extracts facial features using deep learning and classifies Down syndrome with good accuracy. Accuracy can be improved using more data and advanced models.

🔮 Future Enhancements  
- Improve accuracy using deep CNN architectures  
- Mobile application integration  
- Cloud deployment (AWS / Azure / GCP)  
- Real-time face detection using webcam  
- Integration with hospital systems
